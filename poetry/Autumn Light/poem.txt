# Autumn Light

Isolated in my family home
while waiting for inspiration to strike
a gentle nudge from an autumn light caught me by surprise
and became my cheerful companion.

With my mother’s artful eye
she painted magic scenes on the outdoor sail
she sparkled symphony through my glass
she shimmered through the haze of steaming potatoes

and as the days past,
she shared with me her sunset stealing beauty

And made me realise
I wasn’t alone anymore
