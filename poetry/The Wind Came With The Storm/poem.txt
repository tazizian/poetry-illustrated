# The Wind Came With The Storm

The wind came with the storm
So pompous and mighty

The wind came with the storm
And picked me up with his trembling hands

My hair – thousands of unruly strands
Twisting and flying high

Twisting and weaving itself into plaits 
Plaits long, flowing and free

My dress - white silk’s caress
Shamelessly lost to the wind

The wind came with the storm
And picked me up with his trembling hands 

Rising higher and higher
In his embrace

Rising higher and higher
Wandering and free
