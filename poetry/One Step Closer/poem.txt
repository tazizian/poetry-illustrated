# One Step Closer...

The day is hot.
I lean against the cold steel bars.
A gate clicks open, a green light flashes, I'm one step closer.
We stand in an orderly queue, in a narrow corridor, in silence.
I watch a lone soldier inside his box. Dozens of surveillance cameras watch me.
A gate clicks open, a green light flashes, I'm one step closer.
Through the tinted glass the soldier yawns as he answers his mobile phone.
He's all alone in his secured boredom.

I imagine him walking around his quiet neighbourhood.
Messy hair, shorts, flip-flops, narrow shoulders.
Just barely left the nest
What name does his loving mother call him?
Here he controls buttons that open and close the gates.
A gate clicks open, a green light flashes, I'm one step closer.

There used to be birds here.
High up, by the edge of the roof, they weaved their nests.
Have they finally left to inhabit a shaded tree in an orchard?
Where they could raise their chicks freely.
If only I could fly away.
Away from trouble, away from pain, away from memories.
A gate clicks open, a green light flashes, I'm one step closer.
The old man in front of me is examining his permit documents.
His hands are shaking as he pulls out a handkerchief and wipes the sweat off his forehead.
He’s handling each page like it’s the last piece of a complicated puzzle.
The woman next to me carefully places her plastic bags on the conveyor belt.
They clink with pots filled with cakes and biscuits.
She smiles, apologetically.
I hear chirps. The birds!
I look up scanning the roof, searching for them.
A nest full of screaming chicks under the tin roof by the barbed wire.
A tiny mother bird, flapping her tiny wings.
Her head curiously tilted to the side.
She is watching me.
As I wait inside my cage.
A gate clicks open, a green light flashes, I’m one step closer...
