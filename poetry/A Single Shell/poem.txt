# A Single Shell

A single shell is washed up on the beach.
It is tiny, white and fragile.
From inside the deep blue ocean,
Gently delivered by quiet waves
Now it lies here on the sand,
Amongst the thousands of other shells.

A pair of tiny hands carefully scoop the shell up.
It's perfect!
Exactly what the little boy wanted,
His rosy cheeks bloom on his happy face,
His curly hair rustles in the ocean breeze.

His Mum inspects the shell
Yes, dear, its a great find
Take this one home
Letâ€™s make something pretty with it
Or it can just live in our bath.

The boy is about to drop it
Into his yellow toy bucket,
When he notices another shell
It's bigger!
No, that's the one I want Mum!

And our shell is left lying on the beach.
Until a man collects it and twists it under the sun.
Look, darling, it is perfect - just like you.
He pauses, mischievously grinning

He embraces her and slides the shell into her hand
Will you marry me?
Yes! Excited she exclaims,
And drops the shell back on the sand.

The waves lap closer,
The clear water lifts higher,
Our shell's gathered and taken back
Into the deepest heart of the blue ocean,
Until it's offered again to the heart that needs it.
