# A Single Shell

A single shell's washed up on the beach.
It is tiny, white and breakable.
It's been gently carried and delivered by the quiet wave
From deep inside the ocean - the blue heart of the earth.
Now it's lying here, on the sand, amongst the other thousands of shells.

A pair of tiny hands carefully scoop the shell up.
It's perfect!
Exactly what this little boy wanted,
His rosy cheeks bloom on his happy face,
His curly hair brushed by the ocean breeze.

His Mum inspects the shell - yes, dear, take this one home
Letâ€™s make something pretty with it, or it can just live in our bath..
The boy is about to drop it into the bucket, when, he notices another shell
It's bigger!
No, that's the one I want Mum!

And our shell is left lying on the beach.
Until a man collects it and twists it under the sun.
Look, darling, it is perfect - just like you.
He pauses, mischievously grinning

He embraces her and slides the shell into her hand
Will you marry me?
Yes! Excited she exclaims, and drops the shell back on the sand.

The waves shimmer closer, the clear water lifts higher,
Our shell's gathered and taken back
Back into the deepest heart of the blue ocean,
Until it offers it again - to the heart that needs it.
